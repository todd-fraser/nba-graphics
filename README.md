# nba-graphics

This package creates Final Cut Pro .FCPXML files with stats information pulled from data.nba.com API.  NOTE: this will not run on cloud providers like Heroku and AWS, there is some IP blocking by the NBA.

The Final Cut Pro project files are currently specific to custom graphics templates.
